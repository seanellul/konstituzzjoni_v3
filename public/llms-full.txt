and the proportion which the number of candidates elected from the first party bears to the total number of elected candidates is lower than the proportion which the number of votes cast at the first count for the first party bears to the total number of votes counted at the first count for all the parties contesting the election, then the number of members of the first party shall be increased by a number of additional seats (to be referred to as "additional seats") necessary to make the proportion which the number of candidates elected from the first party bears to the total number of elected candidates as nearly as possible equal the proportion which the number of votes cast at the first count for the first party bears to the total number of votes counted at the first count for all the parties contesting that election:
